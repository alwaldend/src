### Subresource Integrity

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to
verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without
unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic
hash that a fetched resource must match.
