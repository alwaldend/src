Host Bot runs Traefik with mTLS in front of T3 Code. The host firewall blocks
direct external access to T3 Code and accepts new connections only on SSH,
HTTP, and HTTPS ports.

T3 Code controls permissions per thread. Its **Auto** mode maps to Codex
Auto-review; modes such as **Full access** deliberately send different thread
settings and override the defaults in `codex_config.toml`.

`T3_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` authenticates the Codex app-server's loopback MCP
connection to T3 Code at `/mcp`. Codex excludes it from model-spawned commands
so those subprocesses do not inherit the credential.

## Deployment

```sh
bazel run //users/simeonwarren/host_bot/ansible
```
